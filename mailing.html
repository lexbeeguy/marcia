        <P> It's been a long time since I've done a group mailing and I hope you are well and have felt or feeling blessings during this unusual time of COVID. </P>

        <P>I have recently become certified as an End of Life Doula for people. This dovetails into my hospice work. I will begin teaching online courses on the end of life for animals through <a href="https://www.internationaldoulalifemovement.com/" target="_blank">The International Doula Life Movement</a>            in 2022. If you'd like information on what a doula does, or about my course, please let me know.</P>

        <P>I love my diversified practice and am here to help you and your animals with a variety of imbalances both physically, emotionally, mentally and spiritually. Here's a brief list of what my work entails.</P>

        <ul>
            <li>Intuitively understanding the cause of behavior issues with animals.<br>I love finding the core of a situation and how this relates to their person. There are deep feelings inside of us that can benefit with awareness and healing that our
                animals are teaching us. </li>

            <li>Healing work through Reiki, QiGong, TongRen, Ho'oponopono and Spirit guidance. </li>

            <li>Helping both people and their animals at the last chapter of life. <br>To know and understand in your heart when and what your animal needs, getting the whole family involved, and walking step by step with your beloved animal till life's end.
            </li>

            <li>I offer bereavement groups and individual sessions after the death of an animal. </li>

            <li>And strictly for the human, soul retrievals, which releases old patterns allowing us a greater sense of freedom within. <br>One of the things I love about this treatment is that the person feels a difference right away! </li>
        </ul>

        <P>If you'd like more information, please call or write! I'd love to hear from you. If you do not want to receive future mailings from me, please respond and I will remove you from my list. </P>
